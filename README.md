# vue-github

## Overview
This was a project done to try out vue for the first time. It utilizes the GitHub API in order to display infomation about a user's account. You can see their repositories and commits through this application.

## Tools
The following tools/libraries were used for this application:
* Typescript
* VueJs
* NuxtJs
* Bulma
* GitHub API

## TODOs
The following is things I would like to do given more time:
* Better styling to the commits page 
* Graphs or some form of visualization to display language/star/forks data of the repos

## Build Setup

```bash
# install dependencies
$ yarn install

# serve with hot reload at localhost:3000
$ yarn dev

# build for production and launch server
$ yarn build
$ yarn start

# generate static project
$ yarn generate
```
